However, both A3 paper and Printer paper were confirmed to be available after initial checks showed they were not listed in the inventory catalog, leading to confusion on their availability. As such, it is recommended to source these items from alternative suppliers such as Office Depot, Staples, or Amazon, since we cannot procure them from our current suppliers due to insufficient inventory listing.
